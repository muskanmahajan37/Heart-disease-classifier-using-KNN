The repository contains code for Classifying Heart Disease Using K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning model.

## What is K-NN Algorithm?

K-NN is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already at the beginning of the 1970s as a non-parametric technique.

The algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, entities which are similar exist together.
